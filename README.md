Fork of [pgn-extract](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/) by David J. Barnes.

Modifications are to change the handling of multiple Elo tags from OR logic to AND logic, and to allow leading or trailing whitepace in the output. To build, run `make` from the `src` directory and the binary will be placed in the project root.
